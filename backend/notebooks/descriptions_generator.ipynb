However, I must point out that three of the properties listed are actually units, not houses. Let me provide you with some information and recommendations based on the available options.\\n\\nIf you're looking for a 3-bedroom house in Sydney, here are a few options to consider:\\n\\n**Riverstone House**\\n\\nThe first option is a stunning 3-bedroom house located at 158 Riverstone Road, Riverstone NSW 2765. This property boasts an impressive 300m² land size and a spacious floor area of 444m². It features modern amenities such as ducted cooling, solar panels, and remote garage, showcasing its energy-efficient systems.\\n\\nThe nearby location to a playground and taxi stand makes it an ideal choice for families and commuters alike. With its unbeatable balance of space, sustainability, and convenience, this property is sure to impress.\\n\\n**Comparison to Units**\\n\\nWhile units in Eastgardens and Dulwich Hill are also available at similar price points ($700,000), the Riverstone house offers more land and a larger floor area. If you're looking for a home with more outdoor space, the Riverstone option might be worth considering.\\n\\n**Other Options**\\n\\nIf you're open to exploring other suburbs in Sydney, I'd recommend checking out Carlton North, where Property 4 is located. This unit offers a prime location close to high school, supermarket, and shopping mall, making it an excellent choice for families or professionals.\\n\\nGosnells, WA (if you're willing to consider another state!) also has some great options available. The 3-bedroom house at 2/17 Hartley Street is built in 2008 and features a spacious floor area of 466m². Its proximity to a taxi stand and playground makes it an ideal choice for families.\\n\\n**Prices and Value Propositions**\\n\\nAll the properties listed are priced at $700,000, which might seem like a lot. However, considering the land size, floor area, and modern amenities offered by each property, I believe they provide excellent value propositions.\\n\\nUltimately, the decision comes down to your personal preferences, budget, and lifestyle requirements. If you're looking for a house with more outdoor space and energy-efficient systems, the Riverstone option might be the way to go. If you prioritize convenience and proximity to amenities, Carlton North or Gosnells could be better suited for you.\\n\\nI hope this information helps you in your search for a 3-bedroom house in Sydney!\", 'success': True}\n"
